Welcome to PiSouls. Your goal is light the first olympic flame at the top of the castle!

If the menu takes too long in the loading screen, reset the game

Here are the controls:
for WASD, use K to jump and L to attack
for ARROWS: use X to jump and Z to attack
You can also use SPACE to jump

ATTACKS:
While on the ground, hold down the attack button to generate a charge attack. The attack has 2 stages
While in the air and moving in a direction, press the attack button to dash in that direction. Must touch the floor before recharging the dash.

TIPS:
Boss HP bars are not present. The final boss has his HP printed on the console every time he is hit
Some enemies hace thick skin, rendering weaker attacks useless. You may need to use stronger attacks
Some enemies have shields or other blocking options, attacks may only work if their gurad is down

COLLECT THE DIAMONDS: They are extremely important and worth a lot of points!!! Collect all 4 to complete your score!

GOOD LUCK!!
